Blau explains, ""You can invest for a great economic return and still have that be something that leaves people feeling better, being happier, and living more meaningful lives."" The firm aims to be thought leaders in identifying the best areas of opportunity for investment and innovation in the wellness and lifestyle sectors, all the while bringing diverse perspectives into the investor pipeline to support underrepresented founders.","Clarifying her firm's goals, Blau notes that they ""use 'positive living lifestyle space' versus 'wellness', which has more defined boundaries, because [they] wanted to take a broader view based on the belief that you can improve the consumer's life from many different angles."" From a higher level, Blau sees that ""at its core this work is part of the American dream.""","https://insider.fitt.co/8-lisa-blau-co-founder-of-able-partners/, https://ablepartners.medium.com/from-founders-to-funders-lisa-blau-and-amanda-eilian-on-the-venture-capital-landscape-0c41a07c82e1"

He is the Founder and Chairman of Qnary, an award-winning global professional reputation management and talent branding solutions company. In addition, Breen has a distinguished career in advertising and digital marketing, having held leadership roles at major agencies and holding companies, including Harte Hanks, a NASDAQ listed marketing services company.","Breen started his career as a WPP Marketing Fellow, the ""golden ticket"" for an ad career, where he spent three years at various WPP agencies. After this exposure, Breen then spent time at Leo Burnett Worldwide, leading their European digital operations and integrating the global digital network now known as Arc Worldwide.","Breen founded and served as President of Bant Breen LLC, strategic marketing and communications consultancy affiliated with Dentsu Inc. After 3 years, Breen went back to industry with IPG, where he held various leadership roles including Executive Director of the IPG Emerging Media Lab, President of Worldwide Digital Communications at Initiative, and CEO of Reprise Media.","In recent years, Breen founded Qnary, where he serves as Chairman & CEO, focusing exclusively on reputation management and talent branding. On the side, he completed his PhD in 2020 at Blanquerna-Ramon Llull University, exploring the perceptions of artificial intelligence in the advertising industry.

He further noted that ""the engagement levels that content gets when it's shared by individuals is anywhere between eight to 20 times greater than what a brand can get organically.""","Qnary's vision is to optimize and grow the online presence of executives, recognizing the impact this has on both personal and business reputation. Breen emphasizes an ""evergreen strategy to build your reputation"" and help executives ""Own your presence and manage that."" The company aims to provide a tech-enabled platform with a ""white-glove approach,"" making it feel like a human experience for users while leveraging advanced technology in the background."," ""My personal mantra is 'Find a Way.' This helps me remain focused on being a creative problem solver."" It was this kind of mindset, he credits, that has driven Qnary's growth from an idea to a global company. Breen also emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptation, evidenced by his late career pursuit of a PhD.",https://www.bantbreen.com 
Tyler Brock,"Charlotte, NC, US","BS in Economics, Computer Science, MMS",Duke University,2007,,,,"Tyler Brock is a seasoned technology executive and entrepreneur with a rich background in finance, software engineering, and leadership. Beginning in finance, he's built and scaled both engineering and early-stage SaaS revenue teams to success. He currently works at MongoDB, where he has been since 2011 (if you ignore the 7 year break he took found, scale, and sell Hustle), as the a Director of Engineer.","After graduating from Duke, Brock started his career in finance, working as an Analyst at BlackRock from 2007 to 2008. He then moved to Harvest Volatility Management LLC, a volatility arbitrage hedge fund, where he served as Vice President of Trading and Research from 2008 to 2011, focusing specifically on yield management, risk reduction, and wealth management solutions.","Brock pivoted into technology, co-founding Antenna.is (formerly ReadrBoard) in 2011, a SaaS helping companies track and improve their customer retention. There, he built the backend stack as the CTO. Following his exit, he joined MongoDB (then 10gen) as a Software Engineer on the Kernel Team - Platforms from 2011 to 2015. During this time, he also briefly worked as an Architect at Wander / Days in 2011, his first time getting inolved in the social networking sector.","After MongoDB, Brock brought his prior experience to co-found and serve as CTO of Hustle, an SMS-based messaging platform that aimed to be a more effective & scaled way of outreach and connection to the younger demographics. It was acquired by Social Capital in 2020; Brock left 2 years later. Since then, Brock has returned to MongoDB as Director of Engineering - Core Server, a position he currently holds.",Graduated from Duke with Distinction; Founded and exited multiple successful SaaS startups,"Hustle, Inc.","Brock doesn't post much. Nor has he said much. But, from his journey, including his pivot, it's safe to say that much of the motivation for co-founding Hustle came from his personal passion in building tech from the ground up and an entrepreneurial drive. Of course, given his stint Wander / Days, a social networking app, part of his motivation for founding Hustle may have also stemmed from a positive experience in the aforementioned sector.","Hustle aims to help organizations connect better with people. Its mission is to strengthen relationships by enabling real, human conversations at scale, allowing organizations to engage audiences with personalized texts and videos, using machine learning to handle millions of interactions. Focused on mission-driven groups, Hustle aims to support advocacy, fundraising, admissions, and recruiting by making communication more direct and impactful.",,
