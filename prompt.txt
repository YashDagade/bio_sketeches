Okay so the thing is this - 


I have this file:

import pandas as pd
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'])

# Reading an Excel file
df = pd.read_csv('empty.csv')

df.head()



that has feilds such as this:

founder,location,UG degree,UG school,g year,G degree,G school,g year,prof summary,early career,mid career,late career,key achievements,selected company,motivation,vision/mission,personal input,sources
Kunal Agarwal,"Palo Alto, California, United States",BS in Computer & Electrical Engineering,Valparaiso University,"2,007",MBA,Duke University,"2,012",,,,,,Unravel Data,,,,
David Aktary,"Austin, Texas, United States",BS in Computer Science,University of Michigan - Dearborn,"2,003",MBA,Duke University,"2,007",,,,,,ERC dEX,,,,




what I want to do is the following, for each person I want to generate professional summaries for them, this is an example of how I have done i for a few:

the first thing I want to do is search for a person to get sources, so basically given a person, search for person's name location and university through duckduck go or something - this is code I had previously for instance


import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

def duckduckgo_search(query, max_results=5):
    search_url = "https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/"
    params = {
        'q': query,
        's': '0',
        'dc': '',
        'vqd': '',
        'o': 'json'
    }
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'
    }
    response = requests.post(search_url, data={'q': query}, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    links = []
    for result in soup.find_all('a', {'class': 'result__a'}, href=True):
        links.append(result['href'])
        if len(links) >= max_results:
            break
    return links

def extract_text(url):
    try:
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'
        }
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=5)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        # Remove scripts and styles
        for script in soup(["script", "style"]):
            script.decompose()
        text = soup.get_text(separator=' ', strip=True)
        # Clean up the text
        text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
        return text
    except Exception:
        return ""

def get_search_text(query, max_results=5):
    urls = duckduckgo_search(query, max_results)
    texts = [extract_text(url) for url in urls]
    combined_text = "\n\n".join(texts)
    return combined_text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_query = input("Enter your search query: ")
    result_text = get_search_text(user_query)
    print(result_text)


the problem with using this is that the reponse is often quite big so perhaps only take the first 10,000 charcthers on that page or something so that we don't waste quite a bit. 

Here is what I want to do, first we will google or use open source serach engine to basically look up the person's first name last name duke university and look at the first 7 links. 

Than we will use these as the prompt for a gpt which will fill out all of these feilds, prof summary,early career,mid career,late career,key achievements, motivation,vision/mission,personal input and sources. For sources, just put the first 7 links that come from teh duck duck go search. 

Give me systematic code that does this for each person, we have a toatl of 161 people, we shoujld first have code that given the output from teh7 links - feeds taht into a gpt input and than uses that to create a systematic output. 

BTW this is how you create a systematic output from chatgpt:

from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed

this is the example reponse:

{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
      "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable.",
      "output": "8x = -23 - 7"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the right side of the equation.",
      "output": "8x = -30"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.",
      "output": "x = -30 / 8"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the fraction.",
      "output": "x = -15 / 4"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "x = -15 / 4"
}


I want you to craet such a structured out put and make sure that your code runs fully. I am in juipternotebook so breakdown each code into secitons and tahn we can run each section step by step. Make sure that your code runs and follows the updated openai api format - tehy changed their api quite a bit, now you have to do this: client.chat.completions.create() so do that please. Make sure the CSV updated is populated correctly and nicely.
